# Python-Silly-Cat-Bot
Source Code for a Discord Bot that sends random Silly Cats

This is just the Code! You have to create a bot yourself and add it to you server.
For that, just create a .env file containing: TOKEN=yourToken

If not done already, install dotenv and discord via pip

pip install discord
pip install python-dotenv

You can do whatever the hell you want with this Code.
Use it to learn how to program a Discord Bot, enhance its features, idk man

Want to add some more Silly Cats? Just put them into the SillyCats Folder!

Want to send some Memes? Replace the Cats with Memes! (And perhaps rename the Folder and the command accordingly)

This bot was mainly written for educational purposes. It serves as a short demonstration for dealing with Files when using your bot.
